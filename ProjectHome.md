# The Xerte Project has moved to GitHub #
### This repository is now closed. ###
Please clone https://github.com/thexerteproject/xerteonlinetoolkits.git. Now that the project is maturing and growing, github meets our needs much better than googlecode, but there's no hard feelings!

If you want to join the developer community, you  should join the dev list at lists.nottingham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/xerte-dev and say 'Hi'. The project is very active, and we are a friendly bunch. Further information on the project can be found here: http://www.ohloh.net/p/xerteproject. Come and join us.
